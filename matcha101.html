      <h3>origins</h3>
      <p>Matcha’s story begins in China during the Tang Dynasty, but it was Japan that refined it into what we know today. Zen monks introduced it in the 12th century and valued it for meditation, as it provided calm focus and steady energy. Over centuries, it became central to the Japanese tea ceremony, symbolizing mindfulness and respect.</p>

        <h3>how it is made</h3>
        <p><strong>Producing matcha is a careful process:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Tea plants are shaded for weeks to boost chlorophyll.</li>
          <li>Young leaves are hand-picked and steamed to stop oxidation.</li>
          <li>The leaves are dried and stone-ground into fine powder.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>This detailed process is why authentic matcha is often costly, but also why it’s so distinct.</strong></p>

      <h3>types of matcha</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ceremonial Grade:</strong> Bright green, smooth, and slightly sweet. Used traditionally, whisked only with water.</li>
        <li><strong>Culinary Grade:</strong> Stronger, more bitter, and darker in color. Best for lattes, smoothies, and desserts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Both carry the same essence of matcha but serve different purposes.</strong></p>
